user-friendly, responsive, and functional. I am a great collaborator and effective communicator. I enjoy leading and being
a part of a team of developers that work on projects that are challenging and will help me grow in my career. In my spare
time, I enjoy playing Final Fantasy XIV and getting out to play ice hockey</p>
