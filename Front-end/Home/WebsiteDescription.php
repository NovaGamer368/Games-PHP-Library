    This website will be a video game library website using PHP as its primary code language. We will display the Name, Creator, Genre, and Description of each game within
    a MySQL database. Along with this, we will have a search feature, which will make going through the data a little easier. If there is no data returned, we will be
    sending back the full list to avoid any issues. There is going to be a login option, so you can log in as an admin to manipulate the data within the database from the
    website. There are going to be some fun styles we are going to implement by storing the preferences of the user in their local storage. By doing this we can keep the
    preference throughout testing and presentation.
