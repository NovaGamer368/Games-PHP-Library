<p>This website is going to be a video game library website using PHP as its primary code language. We will be displaying
    the Name, Creator, Genre and the description of each of the games within a MySQL database. Along with this we will have a search
    feature that will make going through the data a little easier. It there is no data returned we will be sending back the full list to avoid any issues.
    There is also going to be a login option so you can login as an admin to manitpulate the data within the database from the website.
    <br/>
    There are also going to be some fun styles we are going to implement storing the preference of the user on their local storage. By
    doing this we can keep the preference throughout testing and presentation.
